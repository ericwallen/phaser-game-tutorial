# Phaser Game tutorial

### Author: Eric Wallen

Hello! Welcome to this intro to Phaser. With this powerful library you can build HTML5 JavaScript based 2d games for the browser very quickly. Playing games is fun activity perhaps one of my favorites but creating games, believe it or not, can be even more enjoyable! You really get to own it and that is so …. satisfying. Let’s start by answering a few questions. First, do you know a little JavaScript or have coded in some language? Have you touched the command line/prompt once or more and understand how to launch it? Great! Then you will be just fine. If you have some illustrator or design knowledge that can also be helpful but I will supply you all my images so that you can worry about skinning your game the way you want to later. Sound good? In essence this tutorial is meant to be from step one so no previous knowledge about phaser is required. Ok, lets go!
